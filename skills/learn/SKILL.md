description: Persist reusable behaviors from recent interactions, corrections, or successes as updated or new skills or rules.
---

The user invoked /learn to persist reusable behaviors from recent interactions, corrections, or successes. Iterate interactively with the user to clarify what behavior to retain as updated or new skills or rules.

## Identify What to Learn
1. **Analyze User Messages**: Prioritize analyzing recent user messages for explicit corrections, constraints, overrides, or pointers (e.g., "no", "instead", "that failed").
2. **Identify the Fix**: Compare failed attempts with the successful resolution to isolate the pivotal change.
3. **Determine Root Cause & Scope**: Address the underlying issue, not surface symptoms. Determine if it's universal or domain-specific.
4. **Verify if learning is needed**: If the interaction did not reveal any new reusable behaviors or constraints, explain this to the user and exit without proposing changes.

## Classify Rules vs. Skills
1. **Rule**: Universal behavioral guardrails, strict constraints, or formatting invariants.
2. **Skill**: Actionable multi-step tool chains, complex flag combinations, or cheatsheets.

## Create vs. Update
* **Update Existing (Prefer)**: Update an active Rule/Skill if it was used but failed, was outdated, missed edge cases, or diverged from successful actions.
* **Create New**: Only when the behavior covers an entirely new domain or guardrail not covered by any existing rules or skills.

## Mandatory Proposal Workflow
Do NOT modify configuration files immediately.
1. Check the `create-agentsmd` or `writing-for-agents` skill in the skills section or inspect existing workspace rules/skills to follow their exact schema, frontmatter, and directory conventions.
2. Create/update a learning_proposal.md artifact outlining your classification, rationale, and precise text additions/diffs.
3. Set request_feedback = true in ArtifactMetadata for user review.
4. Only execute file/tool modifications after explicit user approval.
